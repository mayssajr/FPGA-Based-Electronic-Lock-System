# FPGA-Based-Electronic-Lock-System
This project implements an electronic lock system on the Altera Intel FPGA DE10-Lite board. The system is designed using VHDL and developed with Quartus Prime. The primary objectives include understanding VHDL basics, designing combinational circuits, and simulating hardware logic to control a lock mechanism.
